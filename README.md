### Plane Tracker Display
Living under or near a busy flight corridor can lead to increasing curiosity. What airline is currently flying over me? What plane is it? How fast is it going? As an aviation enthusiast, these are all questions I've asked myself various times. This project utilizes an ESP32 and 64x64 Hub75 RGB Matrix to find the closest plane to my location, and display its information. I've included the information of the plane's airline name, aircraft callsign, aircraft type, ground speed, transponder/squawk code, altitude, and distance between yourself and the plane in miles.
